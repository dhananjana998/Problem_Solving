"""The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
